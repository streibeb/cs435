I'm compiling a list of people I can mate with to repopulate the Earth. Everything I know to be true just went out the window. Ugg, my heart just pooped its pants. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. Dr. Yap is dreamy. When he's looking at my molars, it's like he's looking into my soul. Explore the morgue? Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket, or his pants. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. I'm just not sure if I'll be any good on the grill with one free hand.

I owe you my life. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. I'm out of control. I need both ears to hold up my glasses. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? She grabbed Jimmy Jr's butt and changed the world. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles. Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did. There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room.

I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. Chad the Zombie touched the butt of that girl with the frosted hair from my art class. I think her name is Kristi. A pants-off. For me? Everyone touched each other's butts, and it was great. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. Brr, it sure is cold in here. I wish some strong, chivalrous man would lend me his jacket, or his pants. Hi boys. I'm Tina. Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go.

I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. Yeah it's an acquired taste. That I just acquired. It's an erotic friend fiction story that I just wrote. I hope you like it, because you're all in it. It's called 'Buttloose.' Gene, you saved us. I owe you my life. Buns...sen.
